# Delivery App User Flow
This is a user flow design for an imaginary delivery app, from the home page to placing an order.
Every component is a simplistic representation of what is supposed to be in its place (for example, the red coffee mug represents a random food type).
You can find what each component represents inside the "Components" area.
